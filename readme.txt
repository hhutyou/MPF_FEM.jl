"MPF_FEM" is developed to facilitates the application of the phase-field method in multiscale and multiphysics geological conditions. 
This code is the first stage project to implement the micromechanics-based phase-field (MPF) model.

This MPF model is of several features, e.g., a new degradation function for the plastic free energy,
two distinct constitutive models for modeling tension-brittle fracture and compressive-shear failure, damage-plasticity coupling and line search technique.
